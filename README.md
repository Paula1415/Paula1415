- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paula1415, I am a high school student living in Argentina and self-taught programmer who really enjoys learning new things and trying different technologies!
- 👀 I’m interested in Web development, python development , and contributing on open source projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms to improve my code performance along the way with react so I can make more beautiful web apps!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use python as it main language, and that are beginner friendly since I am just starting on collaborating on open source.
